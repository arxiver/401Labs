 *          	2.1. if it has empty space
 *          	           insert the item

 *
 * Output: No. of record searched
 *
 * Hint: You can check the search function to give you some insights
 * Hint2: Don't forget to set the valid bit = 1 in the data item for the rest of functionalities to work
 * Hint3: you will want to check how to use the pwrite function using man pwrite on the terminal
 * 			 ssize_t pwrite(int fd, const void *buf, size_t count, off_t offset);
 *
 * 	pwrite() writes up to count bytes from the buffer starting  at  buf  to
